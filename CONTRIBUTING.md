If you want contribute **a small change** (eg. typo) that's how it works:

* Fork the project and make a pull request

If you plan to **collaborate more intensively**, please ask Mario (office@foocoopshop.com) for an ivitation to the foodcoopshop-team. After accepting the invitation, the workflow for contributions is the following:

* Create a new branch within the [main foodcoopshop repository](https://github.com/foodcoopshop/foodcoopshop)
* Using [git flow](http://danielkummer.github.io/git-flow-cheatsheet/) appreciated
* Make a pull request to the develop branch

The branches "master" and "develop" are protected. Only admins can push to those branches.
